<h2><i>What are your three letters?</i></h2>
<h1>MAY are mine, if we continue with the <i>asparagus/resin</i> example from a few pages ago.</h1>

<p>**From here on, you're may need help keeping track of some things, so try to have a piece of paper nearby</p>

---
<h3>Now that you have your three letters, go ahead and write them down (should you gamekeep in such manner.)</h3>

<p>^look, I'm playing too, haha!

<h2><i>anyway,</i> each of those letters has a numeric value based on their position in the alphabet (A is 1, B is 2, ... Z is 26.)</h2>

<p>Pick two letters from your three letter combo, and calculate their numeric positions. <br>i.e. if I chose A and Y, I would have the resulting numbers 1 and 25.
<br><br> make note of those numbers, we'll need them in the <a href="eight.html">next step.<a/>
